# Thin and tender flour tortillas

## Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon of salt = 10g
- 4.5 cups of flour = 730g
- 1/2 cup of lard (preferably back lard) or oil = 80g
- 1+1/3 cup of water = 310g
This gives 16 tortillas, each about 70.5g of dough.

## Steps
### Dough
- Mix salt, flour and lard/oil in the work-bowl. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
- Add watter and process until a cohesive dough forms.
- Kneed until smooth.
- Let it rest for a 15 minutes or so.
### Frying
- Divide the dough into ~16 equal pieces.
- Take one bowl and using a rolling pin, roll the dough into very thin (around 2 mm, diameter ~20 cm) round.
- Heat frying pan (without oil) over medium-high heat -- it has to be very hot to make great tortillas.
- Place dough on the frying pan and cook until bubbles form on top side and bottom side has light brown spots (around 20-30 seconds).
- Flip tortilla and cook until second side develops light browned spots (around half the time of the first side).
Note: you may flip the tortilla a little earlier -- when bubbles form, but there are no browned spots (there should be whitish spots though).
### Serving
Serve immediately or store them for later in a fridge (cover them in something so they do not dry).
They taste best when served warm.
